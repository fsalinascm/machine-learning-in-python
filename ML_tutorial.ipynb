When doing complex machine learning, we heavily rely on objects to store and manage the multitude of data, model parts, and results. This morning, we will be doing a lot of scripting and procedural programming, but we will also be using objects from the python library (i.e dataframes). In the afternoon (and those joining us for Day 2), we will focus more on creating our own objects. While working today, keep in mind that all of this code could be written in a more object-oriented fashion based on the needs of the program."
