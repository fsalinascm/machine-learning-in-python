    "In this tutorial, we'll dig into a few algorithms used in training word embeddings. We'll weight their strengths and weaknesses. \n",

    "Some phrases have a meaning that is _not_ a simple composition of the meanings of its individual words. For example, `red head` or `book worm` don't mean exactly what the combination of their parts might imply. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we tried to get the meaning of `red head` by combining the vectors for `red` and `head`, would we get something that makes sense? `Red` is probably near other colors, `yellow`, `blue`, `green`. `Head` would be near body parts: `leg`, `arm`, `torso`. We'd want `red head` to be near `blond`, `blonde`, and `brunette`. \n",
    "\n",
    "![red-head](figures/red-head-vectors.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get this concept in the right space, we need to change our preprocessing step so that `red head` is treated as one unit, one word. That way, the vector for `red head` is trained separately from `red` and `head`. It's getting the context that `red head` falls into, unlike `red apple` or `red firetruck`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're using FastText, we're also getting some information from the characters of the words, so the information from each piece of the phrase is still somewhat included. "

    "\n",
    "From [the GloVe website](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)\n",
    ">The GloVe model is trained on the non-zero entries of a global word-word co-occurrence matrix, which tabulates how frequently words co-occur with one another in a given corpus. Populating this matrix requires a single pass through the entire corpus to collect the statistics. For large corpora, this pass can be computationally expensive, but it is a one-time up-front cost. Subsequent training iterations are much faster because the number of non-zero matrix entries is typically much smaller than the total number of words in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a co-occurrence matrix example:\n",
    "![co-occurrence matrix](figures/co-occurrence-matrix.png)\n",
    "\n",
    ">GloVe is essentially a log-bilinear model with a weighted least-squares objective. The main intuition underlying the model is the simple observation that ratios of word-word co-occurrence probabilities have the potential for encoding some form of meaning. For example, consider the co-occurrence probabilities for target words `ice` and `steam` with various probe words from the vocabulary. Here are some actual probabilities from a 6 billion word corpus:\n",
    "\n",
    "![probabilities](figures/GloVe.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> As one might expect, `ice` co-occurs more frequently with `solid` than it does with `gas`, whereas `steam` co-occurs more frequently with `gas` than it does with `solid`. Both words co-occur with their shared property `water` frequently, and both co-occur with the unrelated word `fashion` infrequently. Only in the ratio of probabilities does noise from non-discriminative words like `water` and `fashion` cancel out, so that large values (much greater than 1) correlate well with properties specific to `ice`, and small values (much less than 1) correlate well with properties specific of `steam`. In this way, the ratio of probabilities encodes some crude form of meaning associated with the abstract concept of thermodynamic phase.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The training objective of GloVe is to learn word vectors such that their dot product equals the logarithm of the words' probability of co-occurrence. Owing to the fact that the logarithm of a ratio equals the difference of logarithms, this objective associates (the logarithm of) ratios of co-occurrence probabilities with vector differences in the word vector space. Because these ratios can encode some form of meaning, this information gets encoded as vector differences as well. For this reason, the resulting word vectors perform very well on word analogy tasks, such as those examined in the word2vec package."

    "From this [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-explained-state-of-the-art-language-model-for-nlp-f8b21a9b6270) (which I'll quote throughout this section):\n",
    "> BERT’s key technical innovation is applying the bidirectional training of Transformer, a popular attention model, to language modelling. This is in contrast to previous efforts which looked at a text sequence either from left to right or combined left-to-right and right-to-left training. The paper’s results show that a language model which is bidirectionally trained can have a deeper sense of language context and flow than single-direction language models. In the paper, the researchers detail a novel technique named Masked LM (MLM) which allows bidirectional training in models in which it was previously impossible."

    "> As opposed to directional models, which read the text input sequentially (left-to-right or right-to-left), the Transformer encoder reads the entire sequence of words at once. Therefore it is considered bidirectional, though it would be more accurate to say that it’s non-directional. This characteristic allows the model to learn the context of a word based on all of its surroundings (left and right of the word)."
